# Note App

##What is the use of note?
Notes, or what some people refer to as trainer notes, are a way for you to add key points to a presentation that only you can see. 
You can give yourself reminders to jog your memory during a presentation, and notes can also help you stay on topic and keep you from
straying too far away from your subject
